To Install the MapWinGIS.ocx ActiveX component in Delphi, you need to follow these steps.

1.	Click on the "Component" menu in Delphi, then select "Import ActiveX Control..."
2.	In the list of ActiveX components, find and select "MapWinGIS Components", then click the "Install" Button.
3.	It is recommended that you insert it into a new package by selecting the "Into New Package" tab.  
4	Enter the path where you wish to create this package.  I used the same path as the default package,
	but changed the filename to be MapWinGIS.dpk.  
5.	Give the package a description.  I used "MapWinGIS ActiveX Control".  
6.	Press "OK".
7.	Replace the MapWinGIS_TLB file in the "Imports" folder with the one supplied in the zip file.
8.	In the package viewer, click on the MapWinGIS_TLB, then click the Install button.

That should be all you have to do.  A new icon should be available in the "ActiveX" component palette.
Enjoy!  Should you run into any problems, post a message on the forums at http://www.MapWindow.com under the 
"MapWinGIS ActiveX Control Programming" section.
